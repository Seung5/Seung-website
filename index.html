<h2> Themes and story telling topic</h2>
<h3> some common thread <br>
    Classifications of the block<br></h3>
<p> - The Century Condominium which is one the most affluent and fancy residence is located inside a block. However, demographics and articles show that the place is becoming NORC area. Better amenities and transits are convenient factor for everyone but especially for senior citizens. Also, there might be many other unknown reasons but medical facilities are concentrated in the first floor of the building in spite of there are no major general hospital as a pivot point near the building. It would be more interesting to find more information about historical change of population by age for further research. </p>
<p> - Another interesting thing is the identity of the block. Demolition of Century Theatre made The Century Condominium to occupy this site. January 8, 1931. The name "Century"¯ was given to new apartment building ¡®The Century Condominium¡¯ but the theatre remains in the block called Lincoln Plaza Cinemas. Also, the Hotel Empire still using a same name but the building was re-built.</p>
